Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is a data model that describes building and construction industry data. It is a platform neutral, open file format specification that is not controlled by a single vendor or group of vendors. It is an object-based file format with a data model developed by buildingSMART (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability, IAI) to facilitate interoperability in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, and is a commonly used collaboration format in Building information modeling (BIM) based projects. The official IFC documentation and specification can be found at http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/ifc-overview.

COMPAS IFC is a COMPAS extension that allows importing and exporting to IFC files in an accessible, developer-friendly way. It creates a two-way bridge between IFC files and COMPAS data structures. COMPAS IFC allows you to bring IFC contents into COMPAS, process anlyze them in wide range of utilities from COMPAS ecosystem, and export the results back to valid IFC files.
